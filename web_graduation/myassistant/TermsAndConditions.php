      <h2 class="title-en">Terms & Conditions</h2>
      <p class="paragraph-en">
         By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to <b> My Assistant</b>.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-en">
         <b> My Assistant</b> is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-en">
         The <b> My Assistant</b> app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the <b> My Assistant</b> app won’t work properly or at all.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-en">
         You should be aware that there are certain things that <b> My Assistant</b> will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but <b> My Assistant</b> cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-en">
         Along the same lines, <b> My Assistant</b> cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, <b> My Assistant</b> cannot accept responsibility.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-en">
         With respect to <b> My Assistant</b>’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. <b> My Assistant</b> accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
      </p>
